The average AQI represents the overall air quality condition across the last 10 days.
The median AQI shows the central air quality value when data is arranged in order.
Since mean and median are equal (87.5), the AQI data is balanced and not strongly affected by extreme pollution values.
Most AQI values fall between 75–100, indicating Moderate Air Quality conditions.
One higher value (102) slightly indicates increased pollution but does not heavily skew the dataset.
